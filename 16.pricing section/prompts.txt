Prompt: Single-File, Dual-Mode Responsive SaaS Pricing Page

Generate a single, complete, and functional HTML file for a SaaS pricing page named "Atlas SaaS." The file must include all necessary HTML, CSS (using Tailwind CSS), and JavaScript logic to run independently in a browser.

1. Technical & Structural Requirements (Mandatory)

Single File Mandate: All code (HTML structure, Tailwind CSS classes, and JavaScript logic) must reside within one pricing_page.html file.

Aesthetics: Use Tailwind CSS (via CDN).

Font: Use the Inter font via Google Fonts.

General Style: Use modern, rounded corners and clean, highly contrasted layouts.

Colors: Use a primary accent color of Emerald (e.g., emerald-600) for all primary buttons, highlights, and successful indicators.

Responsiveness: The layout must be fully responsive, collapsing the three pricing cards into a single column on mobile (small screens) and displaying them in a three-column grid on desktop (large screens).

2. Functionality Requirements (Interactive)

Dual Light/Dark Mode Toggle:

Include a prominent toggle button (preferably in the header) that switches the entire page between light and dark modes by toggling the dark class on the <html> element.

Ensure all elements (background, cards, text) adapt their colors smoothly.

Billing Cycle Toggle:

Include a functional toggle switch labeled "Monthly" and "Annual" located above the pricing cards.

The toggle must be styled professionally (e.g., a pill-shaped container).

Logic: When switched to "Annual," the prices must update to reflect a 20% discount (mocked in JavaScript) and change the pricing label from /mo to /yr.

Include a callout text nearby: "Save 20% by paying annually!"

3. Content and Tiers

Create three distinct pricing tiers: Starter, Pro, and Ultimate, with the following price and CTA details:

Starter Tier

Monthly Price: $19

Annual Price (20% Discount): $15

Highlight: Standard

CTA Button Text: Start Free Trial

Pro Tier

Monthly Price: $49

Annual Price (20% Discount): $39

Highlight: MOST POPULAR (This tier requires special highlighting)

CTA Button Text: Choose Pro

Ultimate Tier

Monthly Price: $199

Annual Price (20% Discount): $159

Highlight: High-End / Enterprise Focus

CTA Button Text: Contact Sales

Tier-Specific Styling

Pro Tier: This card must be visually highlighted.

Apply a distinct ring border using the primary Emerald color.

In dark mode, add a subtle, visible glow effect (e.g., a box-shadow using a transparent Emerald color) to make it stand out further.

Include a "MOST POPULAR" badge placed prominently on this card.

CTA Buttons: The CTA button for the Pro plan must use the primary Emerald color for the background, while the Starter plan should use a lighter secondary color (e.g., emerald-100 text on white/gray).

Feature List (Per Card)

Each card must contain a detailed list of features with checkmark icons (<svg>) using the primary Emerald color.

Starter (Focus: Essentials): 5 Users, Standard Analytics, 10GB Storage, Basic Email Support, 99.5% Uptime SLA.

Pro (Focus: Growth & Power): Unlimited Users, Advanced Analytics (Custom Reports), API Access, Dedicated Chat/Email Support, Unlimited Storage, 99.9% Uptime SLA, Custom Branding.

Ultimate (Focus: Enterprise): Everything in Pro, plus: White-Glove Onboarding, Custom Security, Dedicated Account Manager, 99.99% Uptime SLA.
