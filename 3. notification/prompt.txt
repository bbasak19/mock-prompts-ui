Create a Notification Widget Box component for a dashboard UI using HTML, Tailwind CSS, and vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks).
You do not need to build the full dashboard, only this widget feature.

🔧 Functional Requirements

Notification Icon Button

Display a notification bell icon (lined SVG style). also icon will visible in the right site of the screen.

When the user clicks this icon, a popover (dropdown box) should open or close.

Use Tailwind CSS transitions for a smooth fade-and-slide animation (e.g., slide down with opacity transition).

Popover Structure

Header Section:

Left: Label “Notifications” in bold text.

Right: A close (×) icon button to close the popover.

Notification List Section:

Each item should include:

A lined SVG profile icon on the left.

A title and short description in the middle.

A timestamp (e.g., “5 min ago”) on the right.

Add visual distinction for unread notifications (slightly highlighted or bold).
Read notifications appear normal or dimmed.

Footer Section:

A centered link/button labeled “View All Notifications”.

UI / Styling Requirements

Must be fully responsive (desktop & mobile friendly).

Include both light and dark mode styling using Tailwind’s dark: variants.

Use clean, minimal design — soft shadows, rounded corners, proper spacing.

Use lined SVG icons (not filled) for all icons (bell, profile, close).

Hover effects for notification items (slight background change).

Smooth open/close animation for popover using Tailwind’s transition, transform, and opacity utilities.

Technical Notes

Use pure JavaScript to toggle the popover visibility and dark/light mode.

Use Tailwind CSS classes only for all styling (no external CSS file).

Include mock notification data (3–4 sample items) in the HTML for demonstration.

Keep HTML semantic and well-structured.
