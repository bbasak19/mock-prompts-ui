QUESTION:
How is light and dark mode compatibility achieved?

ANSWER:
We use Tailwind CSS's built-in 'dark:' utility classes. By adding the 'dark' class to the main HTML tag, colors automatically swap from light primary colors (like white backgrounds and black text) to dark primary colors (like dark gray backgrounds and white text).

QUESTION:
Can I customize the accordion appearance?

ANSWER:
Absolutely! Since the component is built entirely with Tailwind CSS, you can easily modify colors, fonts, spacing, and border styles by adjusting the utility classes applied to the header and content containers.
