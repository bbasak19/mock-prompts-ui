Generate a complete, self-contained HTML document for a modern and fully responsive Shopping Cart Page.

Technology Requirements:

Use the Tailwind CSS CDN for all styling.

The entire application, including all HTML, CSS (via Tailwind), and JavaScript, MUST be contained within this single .html file.

Use the Inter font family (via Google Fonts or a simple Tailwind default font stack).

Design & Layout Principles:

Aesthetics: The design must be clean, professional, and high-conversion focused. Use soft white backgrounds for containers, gentle shadows (shadow-lg), and medium rounded corners (rounded-xl).

Color Palette: Use a neutral palette (shades of gray) with a vibrant, contrasting color (e.g., Indigo or Green) for primary calls to action (the Checkout button).

Responsiveness (CRITICAL):

On mobile devices (screens < 768px), the layout must stack vertically (Cart Items on top, Summary below).

On desktop/tablet (screens > 768px), use a two-column flex/grid layout: Cart Items on the left (approx 60-65% width) and Order Summary on the right (approx 35-40% width). The page must be centrally contained (max-w-7xl, mx-auto).

Content & Functional Sections (Mock Data):

Page Title: A clear title like "Your Shopping Cart" or "Review Your Order".

Cart Items List:

Display a minimum of three distinct mock products. Use compelling product names (e.g., 'Aura Pro Noise-Cancelling Headphones', 'Zenith Ergonomic Mechanical Keyboard', 'Sentinel Smart Home Camera').

Per Item:

Placeholder Image: Use a high-contrast placeholder URL (e.g., https://placehold.co/120x120/4F46E5/FFFFFF?text=Product).

Product Name, Category/Variant (e.g., "Color: Midnight Black").

Quantity Control: Use a responsive input field or simple buttons (+ / -) to manage quantity.

Price Display: Show the unit price and the line-item subtotal.

Removal Action: Include a small 'Remove' button (using a trash icon or inline SVG) to visually remove the item (only mock the removal in JS; don't truly delete it).

Order Summary Card (Sticky on desktop, if possible):

Title: "Order Summary".

Line Items: Clearly display:

Merchandise Subtotal.

Estimated Shipping (e.g., $15.00, Free over $100).

Estimated Tax (calculated at 7.5% of the subtotal).

Order Total (Largest and boldest font).

Coupon Input: An input field for "Coupon Code" with an adjacent 'Apply' button.

Checkout Button: A large, highly visible button labeled "Proceed to Checkout".

JavaScript Implementation:

Create a simple JavaScript function, calculateTotal(), that runs on page load.

The function should:

Initialize mock prices and quantities for the three products.

Calculate the line-item subtotal for each product.

Calculate the Merchandise Subtotal.

Calculate the 7.5% Tax.

Calculate and display the final Order Total in the Order Summary card.

Add simple mock event listeners to the quantity controls so that changing a quantity visually updates the line-item subtotal and the final Order Total.
