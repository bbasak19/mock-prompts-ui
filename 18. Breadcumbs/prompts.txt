# Comprehensive Prompt for Tailwind Components

## Component 1: Breadcrumb Navigation (4 Styles)

### Goal
Create a section containing four distinct, aesthetically different **Breadcrumb Navigation** components. All must be built using **Tailwind CSS**.

### Requirements for Each Style
1.  **Shared Structure:** Each breadcrumb must have 4-5 items (e.g., Home > Category > Subcategory > Product Title). The last item should be marked as the active page.
2.  **Responsiveness:** Ensure long paths wrap gracefully on smaller screens.
3.  **A11y:** Use proper ARIA attributes (e.g., `aria-label="breadcrumb"`, `aria-current="page"`).

### Specific Style Variations

* **Style 1: Simple Default (Classic Separator)**
    * **Separator:** Use a simple chevron or slash (`/` or `>`).
    * **Appearance:** Minimalist, using standard text colors.
* **Style 2: Arrow/Chevron Background**
    * **Separator:** Use a unique shape (e.g., a pseudo-element or border manipulation) to create an **arrow/pointer** style where the background of each item is shaped like an arrow.
    * **Appearance:** Slightly bolder look, maybe using subtle background colors on hover.
* **Style 3: Dot Separator (Minimalist)**
    * **Separator:** Use a small circular dot (`•`) or a colon (`:`).
    * **Appearance:** Very clean and spaced out, suitable for highly professional interfaces.
* **Style 4: Custom Icon Separator**
    * **Separator:** Use a small, decorative icon (e.g., a tiny house, a forward arrow icon from an icon library like Font Awesome/Heroicons mock-up).
    * **Appearance:** Incorporate subtle rounded corners and distinguish the active link with a strong text weight or color.

## Component 2: Product Filter Sidebar Menu

### Goal
Create a complete, responsive **product filter sidebar menu** using **Tailwind CSS**. The component must support both light and dark mode.

### Key Requirements (Tailwind & Responsiveness)

| Feature | Requirement Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Tailwind Utility Classes** | Use utility-first classes exclusively (e.g., `flex`, `p-4`, `bg-white`, `dark:bg-gray-800`). |
| **Responsiveness** | **Mobile First:** Hidden by default on small screens (`sm:hidden`). **Tablet/Desktop:** Visible as a narrow sidebar (`lg:block`, `w-64`). Include a mobile toggle button. |
| **Dark Mode** | Implement the `dark:` prefix for **all** colors (backgrounds, text, borders) for a complete visual transition. |
| **Layout** | Use a flex column for the filters. Ensure padding and margin are consistent. |
| **A11y** | Use appropriate ARIA attributes for the mobile toggle and proper semantic HTML (`<aside>`, `<label>`). |

### Content for Filter Sections

* **Category Filter (Checkboxes):** Electronics, Apparel, Home Goods.
* **Price Range (Slider Mock):** Display a mock range input or two simple input fields (Min/Max).
* **Color Filter (Swatches):** Use small, circular color swatches (e.g., Black, White, Red, Blue).
* **Action Buttons:** 'Apply Filters' and 'Clear All' buttons at the bottom.

## Output Format
Provide the **complete HTML/CSS** for both the Breadcrumb section and the Sidebar section in a single file. Assume Tailwind is loaded via CDN or configured correctly. Ensure all dark mode classes are included in the Sidebar component.
